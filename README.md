# Text Processor â€“ Split, Clean & Transform

This Python script processes a block of text by applying different transformations to each half of the input. It's a demonstration of string manipulation and basic text normalization.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Splits input text into two equal parts
- First half:
  - Converted to uppercase
  - Leading and trailing whitespace removed
- Second half:
  - Reversed
  - Capitalized (first letter uppercase)
  - Punctuation removed
- Final result: the two transformed halves are concatenated

## ðŸ§ª Example

Given this text:

```python
text = "Hello World! Python is awesome."
